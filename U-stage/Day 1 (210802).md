# 2. Record of Learning
## a. Python
- Python is a OOP (object oriented programming) language. It is a module oriented language, which does not execute in an order that it was written 
- Variables in Python
    * Python also adopts dynamic typing. Variable type is set when the program runs. No explicit indication of variable type when declaring variable
    * Variable stores the address of the value that the variable is referring to. Say ``` A = 300 ```, then A stores the address in RAM where 300 is stored
