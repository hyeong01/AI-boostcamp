# 1. Structure of Neural Networks

* Repetition of linear transformation and non-linear transformation
* Linear transformation: X -> Z
  * Use of simple mulitplication and addition (aX+b=Z)
* Non-linear transformation: Z -> H
  * Use of activation functions such as ReLU, tanh functions
* Why multi-layer?
  * According to universal approximation theorem, even two-layer neural network can approximate any continous function. However, having more layers allow the model to have less nodes and thus train faster for the same task.
# 2. How Does a Neural Network Train: Back Propagation

* Training == changing the weight of the neural network so that the loss decreases
* If ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38185429/128058714-1705d4d2-282c-48a8-acfc-99c4a6aeb3d1.png) is negative then increasing W to an adequate amount will likely decrease the loss. Do the same process for all elements if W is a vector.
* However, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38185429/128058714-1705d4d2-282c-48a8-acfc-99c4a6aeb3d1.png) cannot be calculated on spot. L a function of O, O is a function of H, H in function of Z, ... and Z is a function of W. This is why Why we need a chain rule
* Chain Rule:<br/>
